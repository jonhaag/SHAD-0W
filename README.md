Feature prioritization:
1. Driving (F/R, L/R) // Done, needs tweaking and addition of deadzone logic
2. Head/nod bar automatically pivoting when driving // Headbar automation in place - no longer using servo easer
3. Head automation // Done - turn on/off via L1 + O/X
4. Sounds // Sound is enabled, controls in place for 1st 6 sounds available
5. Manual control of head & nod bars - Done - L2 + stick, L1 + stick to control fwd/back & up/down respectively
6. Manual control of head pan/tilt servos
7. Self-balancing via IMU - TBD as this one might be out of my scope of capabilities for now
