100% work in progress

Currently working on cleaning up existing code and prepping to bring in code for drive servos.

Feature prioritization:
1. Driving (F/R, L/R) // Done, needs tweaking and addition of deadzone logic
2. Head/nod bar automatically pivoting when driving // Done via Servo Easter, but slightly delayed - disabled for now
3. Head automation // Done - turn on/off via L1 + O/X
4. Sounds
5. Manual control of head & nod bars
6. Manual control of head pan/tilt servos
7. Self-balancing via IMU
